# Connections

**URL:** [https://app.leadsai.in/connection](https://app.leadsai.in/connection)  

The **Connections** page allows you to **create new** or **update existing** integrations with **Facebook**, **WhatsApp**, and **Instagram** through Meta's platform.  

On top of the page, you will see an **area chart graph** that displays the traffic to your connections over time.

## Creating or Updating a Connection

1. Click the **`+ Add Connection`** button.
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Connection Name** — a recognizable label for your integration*.
   - **Description** — a short explanation of the connection’s purpose*.
   - **Platform** — choose from **Facebook**, **WhatsApp**, or **Instagram***.
3. Click **Next**.

## Platform Authorization Flow

- **For WhatsApp and Facebook**  
  A new browser window will open and redirect you to **Meta’s authentication process**. Follow the on-screen steps to authorize your account.

- **For Instagram**  
  You will be redirected to **Instagram’s OAuth authorization page**. You must grant permission for the Leads AI application to access your **Instagram Business Account**.

## Important Notes

<Note>
All connections must be authorized through **Meta**.  
Leads AI **does not control** the Meta authentication process.  
You can disconnect Leads AI from your Meta Business Account at any time.
</Note>

After successful authorization, your connection will be linked with Meta, and Leads AI will confirm the connection status.

## Post-Connection Setup

Once connected, it is important to **assign a default agent** for handling inbound messages from this connection.

<Warning>If no default agent is assigned, **incoming leads will not be answered by the bot**.</Warning>

To assign a default agent:
1. Open the newly connected integration from the **Connections** page.
2. Select a **Default Agent** for inbound messages.

---

**Next Steps:**  
After your connections are set up and a default agent is assigned, you can start receiving and managing leads through your bot.
