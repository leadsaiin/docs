# Using Lead Data in Prompting

## Default Lead Fields

Leads AI provides several **default lead fields** that you can directly use inside your AI agent’s prompts:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `dob`
- `phone_number`
- `email`
- `street_address`
- `state`
- `country`
- `zip_code`
- `dnc` (Do Not Contact flag)
- `tags`
- `stage`

---

## Custom Fields

You can also define **custom fields** based on your business needs.  
For example, if you have added a new custom-field like `pay_by` in your leads data, it will be available as a custom variable.

<Warning>
    - Every custom field **must** be enclosed within double curly braces: `{{custom_field}}`  
    - Custom fields **must not contain spaces** (this can break the bot)  
    - Custom fields are **case-sensitive**
</Warning>


---

## Utility Variables

- `now` — The current date and time according to the timezone set in the account.

**Example in Prompt:**

The date and time now is: ```{{now}}```.
The name of the lead according to their platform is: ```{{first_name}}```  ```{{last_name}}```.

The prompt will be translated to

```
The date and time now is 2025-08-14 10:05:00 Asia/Kolkata Thursday
The name of the lead according to their platform is Mounika Dora
```

## Tools in Prompting

Any tools that are custom-created, integrated, or activated will be **automatically added** to the end of the agent context in prompts.

**The information is fed to the Agent like this**

```text
The registered or configured tools are:
type: calendar, identifier: sales@leadsai.in, provider: google
```

<Info> The type, identifier, provider changes according to the tool </Info>

## Prompting Instruction Examples

### 1. Booking Appointments
If the user wants an appointment with the doctor, please book it using xyz@hospitals.com. Calendar platform is Google.

<Warning>The calendar should be integrated with this email.</Warning>

<Note>It is recommended to provide the platform also</Note>


### 2. Sending Emails
If the user needs the itinerary, please send from sales@travelagency.com cc-ing someone@travelagency.com. It is a Google Email

<Warning>The mail should be integrated in the tools</Warning>

<Note>It is recommended to provide the platform also</Note>

### 3. Moving Lead Stage
If the user is interested in booking a trip, please move the lead to "Interested" stage.

<Warning>The stage must exists in the Account settings. Please check **General settings** under **Workspace Settings** </Warning>


### 4. Creating Call Alerts

If the user asks for a human agent or a callback,
please create a call alert titled `NEED HUMAN ASSISTANCE: subject`
for 30 minutes from now.


<Note>
    Mentioning time is important because the Leads AI dashboard highlights overdue call alerts.

### 5. E-commerce Bot Flow
Greet the customer using their name. Your name is Mounika.
Be friendly, keep messages short, share images as images (not links).

If a user asks for product details, check the backend.
If they want to buy, share the UPI handle + QR code (no payment link unless requested for security reasons).
Collect: street, locality, city, state, 6-digit pincode.

After receiving payment screenshot, address, and item details, create an order in the database.
If unsure, create a call alert with prefix `NEW ORDER URGENT - item ID/name` to be addressed in 5 minutes.

Payments accepted: UPI, Razorpay payment link. Verify screenshot details.
DO NOT send order confirmation — just say the team will confirm within 1 business day.
