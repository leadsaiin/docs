# Facebook Lead Forms

## What are Facebook Lead Forms

Facebook Lead Forms are interactive forms used within Facebook Ads to collect contact details such as name, phone number, and email directly from potential customers without them leaving Facebook. They are ideal for generating leads quickly and can be fully integrated with Leads AI for automated tracking, follow-up, and campaign management.

Facebook Lead Forms can **only** be created inside **Facebook Ads Manager**. Once created, they can be synced with **Leads AI** for automation and performance tracking.

## How to Sync Facebook Lead Forms with Leads AI

To sync your lead forms:

1. Navigate to [https://app.leadsai.in/facebook/lead-forms](https://app.leadsai.in/facebook/lead-forms)
2. Select the Facebook Page that owns the lead form.
3. Click **Sync** to import your forms into Leads AI.

Once synced, the forms can be connected to campaigns and trigger WhatsApp messages.

## Configuring a Facebook Lead Form

- **Campaign Assignment** – A lead form can be linked to a campaign in Leads AI to track leads and monitor performance.
- **Automated WhatsApp Messaging** – You can automatically send a **WhatsApp template message** as soon as someone submits a Facebook lead form.  
  
  <Note>A WhatsApp Business Account must be linked with Leads AI for this feature to work.</Note>

### Rules for WhatsApp Template Field Mapping

The following fields are **strict** and must be used exactly as defined. 

<Note>For the strict fields, please use the contact fields in facebook lead forms instead of creating your own fields</Note>

- `full_name` – Lead's name *(optional)*  
- `phone_number` – Lead's phone number *(mandatory, required to send WhatsApp messages)*  
- `email` – Lead's email address *(optional)*

Any other fields present in your lead form will appear on the **right-hand side** of the lead form details page in Leads AI.

<Tip>
After connecting a WhatsApp template to a lead form, click **Compare Variables** to verify all required variables are mapped correctly and no variables are missing.

### Example – Using Custom Fields in a WhatsApp Template

If your Facebook lead form contains the following fields:

- `full_name`
- `email`
- `phone_number`
- `your_business` *(custom field)*

You can create a WhatsApp template such as:

```
Hey there {{full_name}}. I saw you filled out a form through our Facebook ad.
You have mentioned the email as {{email}} and your business as {{your_business}}.

```


The variable names (`{{full_name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{your_business}}`) should match exactly those shown on the **right-hand side** of the Lead Form details in Leads AI.
