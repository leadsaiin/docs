## What is a Facebook Post

A Facebook post is a piece of content shared by a person, page, or business on the Facebook platform. Posts can include text, images, videos, polls, links, or other media to build engagement, promote campaigns, share updates, or interact with the audience.  
In the context of **Leads AI**, Facebook posts are a source of direct customer interaction — any engagement, such as likes, comments, or shares, can be tracked and converted into leads or campaign insights.

## How to Sync Facebook Posts with Leads AI

To sync your Facebook posts with Leads AI:

1. Navigate to [https://app.leadsai.in/facebook/posts](https://app.leadsai.in/facebook/posts).
2. Select the Facebook page you want to sync.
3. Click **Sync** to pull the latest posts into Leads AI.

Once synced, these posts can be configured for automated engagement and lead tracking.

## Configure a Facebook Post

You can configure a synced Facebook post to trigger specific actions based on user interactions.  

- **Assign Campaigns** – Link the post to a specific campaign by editing the campaigns section.  
- **Comments Configuration** – Decide what action to take when someone comments on your post.

<Note>
Always select **Static** as the Action Type for comment responses unless you specifically want to route comments to an agent. Using **Agent** will consume AI message quota according to your pricing plan, which may incur additional costs.
</Note>

### Comment Configuration Elements

There are 6 key elements:

- **Condition** – Select how the comment text is matched:  
  - *Is Equals*: The comment must exactly match the given value.  
  - *Contains*: The comment must include the keyword anywhere in the text.
- **Value** – The specific word or phrase the comment should match against.
- **Action Type** – Choose between:  
  - *Static* – Sends a fixed, predefined reply **(highly recommended)**.  
  - *Agent* – Routes the comment to a chatbot or live agent **(Very less recommended)**.
- **Action Mode** *(Static only)* –  
  - *Reply*: Posts a public comment reply.  
  - *DM*: Sends a private message directly to the user.
- **Select Agent** – If using Agent mode or DM, specify the agent that will respond to the user.
- **Response Text** – The exact message or script sent in reply or DM.

You can add multiple comment configurations to handle different types of comments.
